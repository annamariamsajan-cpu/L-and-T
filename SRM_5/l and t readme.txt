# Project Title: Battery Charging from Solar Panel (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Aim
To simulate the process of a solar panel generating power, a power meter monitoring energy flow, and a battery charging from this energy within Cisco Packet Tracer—leveraging IoT capabilities for visualization.

## Results
- Solar panel generates power (e.g., ~117 V output)
- Power meter records real-time energy flow (e.g., ~109 Wh)
- Battery receives and charges from solar-generated energy
- (Optional) IoT monitoring enabled via Home Gateway and IoT Server to visualize system status in a web interface
